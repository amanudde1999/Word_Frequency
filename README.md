# Word_Frequency
This program takes in an input text (from an input file provided as a command line argument) and proceeds to perform word frequency analysis.


In the freq.py 3 functions were used. frequency_calculation for calculating the frequencies for each word and storing it in a list. print_table will format the printing of each line and pair the items in the dictionary with the correct frequency. frequency generates the dictionary and uses a count, words are placed as keys and each time there is a repetition, count will increment, if it is the first time that word is encountered, it will be stored as a key.
Both print_table and frequency_calculation were used in frequency.
